The ‘Cocktail Manager’ app does not process users' personal data.

The app works completely offline, with a local database (SQLite).

If the user voluntarily enables synchronisation with Firestore, cocktail data, images and set preferences are stored in Firestore.

No personal identification data (such as name, e-mail, phone number) is collected or shared.

The app uses only the following permissions:

Internet access (for Firestore synchronisation)

Camera (for taking cocktail photos)

Storage (for storing images locally)

If you have any questions, please contact the developer's email address.
