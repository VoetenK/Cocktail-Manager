Frequently Asked Questions

How do I sync my data between devices?

Make sure Firebase synchronization is enabled in the settings. After that, you can allow other users or devices to sync with your shared Firestore environment.

Can I add my own recipes?

Yes! Use the + button or the edit icon to add your own cocktails, ingredients, or glassware. Everything is automatically saved on your device and, if enabled, also synced to the cloud.

Where are my photos stored?

Photos are saved locally on your device. You can optionally upload them to Firebase Storage, making them accessible across all your devices.
